The CSS property `content` is not working as expected when used with the `::before` or `::after` pseudo-elements.  The content should display some text or other content, but nothing appears.  This is happening despite the fact that I have the right selectors and the `display` property set appropriately.  I tried different content values (text, images) and updated the browser but it doesn't show the content. The element is there but the content is not displayed.
