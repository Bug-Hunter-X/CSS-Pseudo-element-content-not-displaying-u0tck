# CSS Pseudo-element Content Not Displaying

This repository demonstrates a common issue where CSS `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements fail to display their specified content. The bug.css file contains the problematic code, while bugSolution.css offers the solution.

**Problem:**
The `content` property within the pseudo-elements does not render the expected text or other content, despite the correct element selection and setting of display properties.

**Solution:**
The bug is often caused by missing or incorrect values for other CSS properties. The bugSolution.css file resolves this by fixing the necessary properties and providing examples of how to use the `content` property effectively. 

This repository is useful for developers experiencing similar issues and serves as a good example of debugging CSS pseudo-elements.
